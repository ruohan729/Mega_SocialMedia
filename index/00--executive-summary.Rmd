Manufacturing companies need to forecast the demand of their products ahead of time, because failing to predict the future demand can result in product surplus or shortage. In an era where social media dominates people’s lives, data analytics has become a powerful tool to generate actionable business insights.  Scholle IPN tasked us to test if social media brings any predictive power to forecast the future Coca-Cola bag sales. In this project, we examined whether people’s discussion and engagement on social media have any impact on the consumption of Coca-Cola products in real life. In addition to our team, two other research groups analyze different types of independent variables to predict Coca-Cola bag sales.

In order to achieve that, we collected external data from social media sources and combined it with internal data provided by Scholle IPN. After preliminary exploratory analysis, we built traditional and advaned machine learning models, including regression with ARIMA errors model, XGBoost model and Long Short-Term Memory (Recurrent Neural Network) model. The XGBoost model using the differenced social media variables returned the best predictions while still maintaining a decent level of interpretability. This model combined with other challenger models were stacked together to create three variations of ensemble models - mean average, stacked linear regression, stacked random forest. 

Key findings from this project include the following:

1. Pepsi and Taco Bell lagged variables were observed to have the most importance among predictors, according to the XGBoost model feature importance.
2. Ensemble modeling proved to be a great approach to bring individual models together.  Among all the social media models, the stacked linear regression model had the best combination of accuracy and stability. Furthermore, ensembling the models from all Scholle IPN research teams produced the best overall model.
3. Identifying cross-correlated variables and conducting principal component analysis were vital steps for modeling. These procedures to reduce the dimensionality of social media variables led to an improved accuracy. 


We concluded that Scholle IPN should utilize social media data sources together with their internal sales data to forecast future Coca-Cola bag demand.  For future work, we recommended an examination of the year-to-year comparison between the forecasting bag sales with the actual bag sales.
