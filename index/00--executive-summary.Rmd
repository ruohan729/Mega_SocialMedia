Manufacturing companies need to forecast the demand of their products ahead of time, so that raw material preparation, production, and shipping schedule can be arranged accordingly. Failing to predict the future demand can result in waste due to over-producing, business opportunities lose because of under-stocking or unable to deliver in  a timely manner, etc. In an era where social media dominates people’s life, and  data analytics are growing more and more powerful when it comes to drawing insights to enhance business actions, Scholle IPN tasked us to test if Social Media brings any predictive power to forecast the future Coca-Cola bag sales. With this problem stated, we took this task on as a trial to examine whether or not people’s discussion and engagement on Social Media has any impact on the consumption of the Coke product in real life. 

In order to achieve that, we started with gathering external data from Social Media, and combined with the internal data provided by Scholle IPN. After preliminary exploratory on the data - both internal and external, we built traditional Regression with ARIMA errors models, then more advanced Machine Learning models, namely, XGBoost and LSTM RNN. XGBoost using the differenced social media variables gave the best predictions (lowest sMAPE score) among all the individual models while still has a decent level of interpretability for us to explain the model. 
Since we obtained the various predicting results from the single predicting models, we also stacked these individual models together and created three ensemble models - mean average, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.  Random Forest ensemble model achieved the best outcomes, with the lowest error score. 
Key findings from this project including the following:

* Social Media contents, specifically, online discussions and engagement level of certain brands and ad campaigns have helped Machine Learning models to forecast the future bag sales. 
* Different Social Media variables have different importances when it comes to modeling. For instance, the jobs related conversation online demonstrated higher level of importance than other brands-related conversations in our XGBoost model feature importance. 

* Reducing the dimensionality when handling a large number of features improves the predictive accuracy; Cross Correlation check, Principal Component Analysis are also vital before modeling in our case. 

* Ensemble modeling is a great way to bring the individual models together as inputs, and establish a better model with stronger predictive capacity. The output from the ensemble model has been proven to be the best results out of all. 
We recommend Scholle IPN to continue monitoring the Social Media conversations, and follow our practice of adding the social media variables to the internal historical sales data. For future work, we also recommend to examine the year-to-year comparison between the forecasting bag sales with the actual bag sales.
