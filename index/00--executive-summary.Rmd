Manufacturing companies need to forecast the demand of their products ahead of time, and failing to predict the future demand can result in over-producing, loss of business opportunities, etc. In an era where social media dominates people’s life, and  data analytics are growing more and more powerful on generating actionable business insights, Scholle IPN tasks us to test if social media brings any predictive power to forecast the future Coca-Cola bag sales. In this project, we examine whether or not people’s discussion and engagement on social media have any impact on the consumption of the Coke product in real life. 

In order to achieve that, we start with collecting external data from social media, and combine with the internal data provided by Scholle IPN. After preliminary exploratory analysis, we build traditional Regression with ARIMA errors model, then more advanced machine learning models, namely, XGBoost and LSTM RNN. XGBoost using the differenced social media variables returns the best predictions (lowest sMAPE score) among all the individual models while still has a decent level of interpretability. Following individual models and their results, we stack these individual models together and create three ensemble models - mean average, linear regression, and random forest. Linear regression ensemble model achieves is the most stable, with the lowest error score. 

Key findings from this project including the following:

1. Different social media variables have different importances when modeling. Surprisingly, Pepsi and Taco Bell lagged variables showed the most importance among the predictors according to our XGBoost model feature importance.
2. Ensemble modeling is a great way to bring the individual models together, and establish a better model with stronger predictive capacity. We observe the forecasts of the ensemble model to be the best among all indidivual models. Furthermore, ensembling the models from all Scholle IPN capstone teams produced the best overall model.
3. Reducing the dimensionality when handling a large number of features improves the predictive accuracy; Cross Correlation check, Principal Component Analysis are vital steps for modeling. 

We conclude that Scholle IPN should continue monitoring social media conversations, and follow our practice of adding the social media variables to the internal historical sales data. For future work, we recommend an examination of the year-to-year comparison between the forecasting bag sales with the actual bag sales.
