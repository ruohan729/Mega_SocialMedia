# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

In summary, we learned that including social media variables is helpful in predicting Coca-Cola bag orders, and it also provided a comparable results to the Scholle Coca-Cola baseline model.  For the individual models, the best results came when the social media variables were differenced or when the dimensions were reduced leading to increased predictive power.  When comparing the two challenger models, the XGBoost model did a better job of capturing seasonality than the regression with ARIMA errors model, as well as the LSTM RNN.  In addition, the XGBoost approach allows us to point out the most important variables.
As for an ensemble approach to modeling, this technique proved to be a strong approach to produce better forecasts.  For our project, the random forest ensemble returned the best RMSE and sMAPE values.  For the ensemble models among the different teams, a linear regression model produced an output that was incrementally better than any individual model.





# Recommendations {.unnumbered}

For this project, we focused our data collection on only a handful of quick service restaurants and competitors.  Collecting social media data from Coca-Colaâ€™s competitors presents an opportunity to look at how people engage with and view these beverage companies at an industry level. Hence it may bring better accuracy in predicting the Coca-Cola bag sales for Scholle IPN.
